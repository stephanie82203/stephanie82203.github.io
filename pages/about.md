    <h1 style="margin:0 0 8px 0; line-height:1.1;">Hello! I'm Stephanie.</h1>
    <p>
    I'm someone who likes figuring things out, fixing messy problems, and finding the fastest way to get things done (half efficiency, half smart-lazy logic).
    </p>
    <p>
    I studied <strong>Statistics</strong> with an <strong>Economics minor</strong>, starting in mathematics and computational courses before realizing I prefer working with real patterns, behaviour, and decisions — and turning them into something people can actually understand.

    <h2>How I Work</h2>
    <p>
      I like to keep things clear, simple, and intentional.
      I break problems into steps, remove what isn’t needed, and build processes that make work feel lighter for everyone involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If something is inefficient, I fix it. If something is confusing, I clean it up.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Years of customer-facing roles taught me how to read a room, stay calm, and explain things without overcomplicating them. Whether I’m presenting results or fixing something mid-conversation, I focus on clarity and connection.

    <h2>What I Can Do</h2>
    <p>
      ✨ Python, R, SQL, Excel, and Power BI are my core tools — and I’m leveling up with Advanced Python, deeper SQL work, and new tools like Azure and Tableau.
    </p>
    <p>
      ✨ I also have a foundation in Python, Java, R, and C from my computational mathematics coursework, where I focused on algorithms and abstract data types.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy transforming raw information into clear, authentic visuals. Design matters to me — not just how something looks, but how it guides attention and makes decisions easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use machine learning at a practical level, focusing on models that reveal patterns without overwhelming people with unnecessary detail.

    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m drawn to systems, behaviour, and understanding the “why” behind patterns.
      I take on projects that force me to connect real problems with practical solutions.
      I don’t pretend to know everything, but I don’t stay confused for long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I snowboard ❄️ shuffle dance 🕺 street photography 📷 and try new things even when I’m clueless at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m a visual learner with a short attention span, so I naturally design workflows that are direct and time-saving.
    </p>
    <p>
      I value clarity, efficiency, and getting things done — and that shows up in how I build, how I communicate, and how I work with people.

    <h2>What I’m Building Toward</h2>
    <p>
      I’m exploring work that combine analysis, design, and practical storytelling — projects that simplify complex problems and help people see the bigger picture 📊🧩
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to keep sharpening my technical skills, refine my visual style, and build a portfolio that reflects both my abilities and the way I think.
