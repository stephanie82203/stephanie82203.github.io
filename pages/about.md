# About Me

Hi, I'm **Stephanie Cheng** — an early-career analyst who loves building real-world data and BI projects.

I recently completed my degree in **Statistics (with Economics)**, and I’m especially interested in:

- Building dashboards and reports that real people actually use  
- Exploring how data connects to the economy, businesses, and everyday decisions  

On this site, you’ll find:

- **Projects** – like recession risk modeling, Steam game price analysis, HR analytics, and more
- **Learning notes** – stats, machine learning, BI tools, and more  
- **My resume** – if you’re curious about my background or want to work together  

Outside of data, I enjoy things like snowboarding, gaming, and learning languages — but most of all, I like building things that feel useful and a little bit fun. 😊
