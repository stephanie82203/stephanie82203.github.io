    <p style="margin-top: 0;">
    Someone who likes figuring things out, fixing messy problems, and finding the fastest way to get things done (half efficiency, half smart-lazy logic).
    I studied <strong>Statistics</strong> with an <strong>Economics minor</strong>, starting in mathematics and computational courses before realizing I prefer working with real patterns, behaviour, and decisions — and turning them into something people can actually understand.

## How I Work
<p style="margin-top: 5px;">
I learn fast, apply things even faster, and keep everything simple.
I break problems into steps, cut unnecessary work, and build processes that save time for both me and whoever uses them.
If something is inefficient, I fix it. If something is confusing, I clean it up.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5px;">
Years of customer-facing roles taught me how to read a room, stay calm, and explain things without overcomplicating them. 
I communicate clearly and work well with people — whether it’s presenting results or solving something on the spot.

## What I Can Do
<p style="margin-top: 5px;">
✨ I use Python, R, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, and I’m leveling up with Advanced Python, deeper SQL work, and new tools like Azure and Tableau.

✨ I also have a foundation in Python, Java, R, and C from my computational mathematics coursework, where I focused on algorithms and abstract data types.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5px;">
I like turning information into clear, authentic visuals. I enjoy design, and I care about how things look, how they flow, and how people interact with them.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5px;">
I use machine learning at a basic, practical level, and I like building tools that help people see patterns without digging through endless numbers or code.
</p>

## What Drives Me
<p style="margin-top: 5px;">
I like understanding systems, behaviour, and the “why” behind patterns.
I take on projects that force me to connect real problems with practical solutions.
I don’t pretend to know everything, but I don’t stay confused for long.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5px;">
Outside of work, I snowboard, shuffle dance, take random photos, and try new things even when I’m clueless at first.
I’m a visual learner with a short attention span, so I naturally design workflows that are direct and time-saving.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5px;">
I value clarity, efficiency, and getting things done — and that shows up in how I build, how I communicate, and how I work with people.
</p>

## What I’m Building Toward
<p style="margin-top: 5px;">
I’m focusing on projects that combine analysis, design, and practical storytelling — the kind of work that simplifies complex problems and helps people make confident decisions.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 5px;">
My goal is to keep growing my technical skills, sharpen my visual style, and build a portfolio that reflects both my abilities and the way I think.
